# Unsupervised-Learning
To understand K-means Clustering by applying on the Car Dataset to segment the cars into various categories.


DOMAIN: Automobile

• CONTEXT: The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5
continuous attributes.

• DATA DESCRIPTION:
  cylinders: multi-valued discrete acceleration: continuous
  displacement: continuous model year: multi-valued discrete
  horsepower: continuous origin: multi-valued discrete
  weight: continuous car name: string (unique for each instance)
  mpg: continuous
  
• PROJECT OBJECTIVE: To understand K-means Clustering by applying on the Car Dataset to segment the cars into various categories.
